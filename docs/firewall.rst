Linux Firewall
===============

.. image:: img/firewall.png

.. note:: This chapter is an ongoing work.

A firewall is a network security system, which can monitor and control network
packets coming in and going out from a system based on pre-defined rules.

In this chapter, we will learn about **iptables** command and how can we use
the same to create and manage the system's firewall. The `netfilter
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter>`_ subsystem in Linux Kernel handles
the actual packet filtering in the network level.



Installation
-------------

On CentOS

::

    yum install iptables-services


On Debian systems

::

    apt install iptables-persistent


Tables, chains and rules
-------------------------

There is a table based system which in turn uses chains of rules for the
firewall. Each table has a defined set of chains, and the rules get into the
get chain one after another.

When a network packet reaches the related table, and the related chain inside
of the table, the rules gets matched from top to bottom. If the packet matches
then the *target* of the rule gets executed. Each chain also has a default
policy, if no rule matches, then, the default poilicy gets applied on the
packet. We will learn more about these in details.

iptables has 5 built in chains.

- **INPUT** for all packets incoming to the system
- **OUTPUT** for all packets going out from the system
- **FORWARD** for the routed packets, this is when the system works as a router
- **PREROUTING** for port forwarding
- **POSTROUTING** for Source Network Address Translation (SNAT), this applies to all
  packets leaving the system

filter table
-------------

**filter** is the default table of iptables. It has 3 default chains.

- INPUT
- OUTPUT
- FORWARD

nat table
---------

**nat** table is a special table for SNAT and DNAT (port forwarding).
It has the following chains.

- PREROUTING
- POSTROUTING
- OUTPUT

There are two other different tables, **mangle** and **raw**.

iptables command
-----------------

The following table will be helpful in remembering different arguments to
**iptables** command.

::

    +------------------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+-------------+
    | Table            | Command      | Chain               | Matches                | Target/Jump |
    +------------------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+-------------+
    | filter (default) | -A (append)  | INPUT               | -p protocol            | ACCEPT      |
    | nat              | -I (insert)  | OUTPUT              | -s source_ip           | DROP        |
    | mangle           | -D (delete)  | FORWARD             | -d destination_ip      | LOG         |
    | raw              | -R (replace) | PREROUTING          | --sport source_port    | REJECT      |
    |                  | -F (flush)   | POSTROUTING         | --dport destination_ip | DNAT        |
    |                  | -L (list)    | USER_DEFINED_CHAINS | -i incoming            | SNAT        |
    |                  | -S (show)    |                     | -o outgoing            | LIMIT       |
    |                  | -Z (zero)    |                     | -m mac                 | RETURN      |
    |                  | -N           |                     | -m time                | MASQUERADE  |
    |                  | -X           |                     | -m quota               |             |
    |                  |              |                     | -m limit               |             |
    |                  |              |                     | -m recent              |             |
    +------------------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+-------------+


View the existing rules
------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # iptables -nvL --line-numbers
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 82 packets, 4756 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 42 packets, 3192 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination


The above command shows the default table **filter** and all chains and rules
inside of it. You can notice that each of the chains has a default policy
**ACCEPT**. It means if no rules match (in this case no rules are defined), it
will accept those packets.


Appending rules to INPUT chain
-------------------------------

We can test an initial rule to **drop** all incoming *icmp* packets to the
system. The following rule will append the rule to the **INPUT** chain.

.. note:: `ping` command uses `icmp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol>`_ packets. So, the following command will block
          `ping` into the system.

.. code-block:: bash

    iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP

Now, if you try to ping the system from any computer, you will not get any
response.

Flushing all rules
-------------------

::

    iptables -F

The above command will help to flush (remove) all the rules from the default
table. You can actually use *-t TABLE_NAME* argument to flush any particular
table.


Example of a series of rules
-----------------------------

Here is a list of rules to allow traffic to port 22 (ssh) and port 80 and 443
(http and https).

::

    iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT
    iptables -A FORWARD -j REJECT

The first rules allows all incoming traffic on the `loopback` device.
The second line allows packets related to an already established connection,
or the cases where a packet is trying to reconnect.
The last 3rd last line allows all outgoing packets, and the last 2 lines
reject everything else which does not match the rules.
If you want to view all the rules.

::

    # iptables -nvL --line-numbers
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    1        0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  lo     *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
    2      122  9641 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
    3        1    52 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state NEW tcp dpt:22
    4        0     0 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:80
    5        0     0 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:443
    6       22  2044 REJECT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-port-unreachable

    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    1      104 12085 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0

The *--line-numbers* argument shows the number of the each rule. We can use
these line numbers to delete any rule.

.. note:: For a desktop or laptop, you may want to drop all incoming connections, that will help in cases
          where someone in the local network may try to attack/scan your system.


Delete a rule based on rule number
-----------------------------------

Let us delete the rule number 4, which allows traffic to port 80.

::

    # iptables -D INPUT 4
    # iptables -nvL --line-numbers
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    1        4   376 ACCEPT     all  --  lo     *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
    2      221 15445 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
    3        1    52 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state NEW tcp dpt:22
    4        0     0 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:443
    5       22  2044 REJECT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-port-unreachable

    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    1      166 17248 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0


Delete a rule directly
-----------------------

If you know the rule properly, you can also delete it based on the rule
directly.

::

    # iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -nvL --line-numbers
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    1        4   376 ACCEPT     all  --  lo     *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
    2      344 22417 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
    3        1    52 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state NEW tcp dpt:22
    4       22  2044 REJECT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-port-unreachable

    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    1      234 22564 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0


Saving the rules
----------------

Any change made via **iptables** command stays on memory. To save it (so that
it autoreloads in reboot), use the following command.


For Debian.

::

    # netfilter-persistent save


For CentOS 7+

::

    # systemctl stop firewalld && systemctl disable firewalld
    # iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
    # systemctl enable iptables
    Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/basic.target.wants/iptables.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/iptables.service.
    # systemctl start iptables

The first line stops and then disables the **firewalld** service, it is a newer
type of frontend for the same *netfilter* subsystem of the kernel.

A blog post from Major Hayden
------------------------------

Now, you should read the `following blog post
<https://major.io/2010/04/12/best-practices-iptables/>`_ from Major Hayden
best practices.


Debugging firewall rules
-------------------------

In case you want to debug the rules, and wan to see which packet matches which
rule in the chain, you can add these two following rules. After that, do
**tail -f /var/log/kern.log** to see the messages. Remember to use the proper
IP address and port number.

::

    # iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination YOUR_IP/24 --dport PORT_NUMBER -j TRACE
    # iptables -t raw -A OUTPUT -p tcp --destination YOUR_IP/24 --dport PORT_NUMBER -j TRACE
