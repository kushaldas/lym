## Networking commands

In this chapter, we will learn about a few basic networking commands, which will help us in our daily Linux usage.

```eval_rst
.. index:: ip
```
### Finding the IP address

The *ip* command can be used to find the IP address of the system.

```
$ ip addr show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1454 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:3c:ed:27 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.10.95.253/20 brd 172.10.111.255 scope global dynamic eth0
       valid_lft 57021sec preferred_lft 57021sec
    inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:fe3c:ed27/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Here *lo* is a special device which points to the same system (also known as *localhost*). The IP *127.0.0.1* always points to the the *localhost*.   
*eth0* is our ethernet device which connects to the network.

```eval_rst
.. index:: ping
```
### ping command

*ping* is simple way to find if you are connected to Internet or not.   
We can also ping any particular computer to find if the computer is connected to the network or not. Press *Ctrl+c* to stop the loop.

```
$ ping google.com
PING google.com (216.58.201.142) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from mad06s25-in-f142.1e100.net (216.58.201.142): icmp_seq=1 ttl=44 time=157 ms

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 156.373/156.811/157.566/0.704 ms
```

```eval_rst
.. index:: dns
```

### Short note about DNS

DNS or Domain Name System is a decentralized naming system for systems which are connected to Internet (can be for private networks too). This is the way a computer knows, which other computer to connect to, when we type google.com in our browser, or in the ping command.   
There are servers known as dns servers, and for every domain name it needs to find, the client system generally connects to these dns servers, and finds out the IP address of the computer at that domain name.

### /etc/resolv.conf

*/etc/resolv.conf* is the configuration file for DNS. It contains the DNS server address to use for DNS queries.

```
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf 
# Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```

The *1.1.1.1* is the DNS server from Cloudflare, and *8.8.8.8* is the DNS server
hosted by Google.


```eval_rst
.. index:: host
```

### host command

The ```host``` command will show you the IP address of any given hostname.

```
$ $ host www.example.com
www.example.com has address 93.184.216.34
www.example.com has IPv6 address 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946
```


```eval_rst
.. index:: dig
```

### dig command

*dig* command can tell us DNS records, MX details (used to send emails) and other information for a given domain name.

```
$ dig kushaldas.in

; <<>> DiG 9.10.4-P8-RedHat-9.10.4-5.P8.fc25 <<>> kushaldas.in

If you want to specify a DNS server to use, you can do that with the address specified at the end of the command along with a @ sign.

```
$ dig rtnpro.com @208.67.222.222

```eval_rst
.. index:: ss
```
### ss command

*ss* command shows us socket statistics from the system. This command replaces the older netstat command.   
Read the man page of the command to know more about the different arguments we can pass at the command line.

```
$ ss -putn
Netid State      Recv-Q Send-Q                           Local Address:Port                                          Peer Address:Port

```eval_rst
.. index:: traceroute
```
### traceroute command

The *traceroute* command is used to show the full route of a network packet from the system to any given host.

```
$ traceroute www.rtnpro.com

```eval_rst
.. index:: tracepath
```
### tracepath command

The *tracepath* command traces a path to a network host discovering MTU along the path. This is a modern replacement of the *traceroute* command, and also does not need superuser privileges to execute.

```
$ tracepath www.rtnpro.com

```eval_rst
.. index:: ssh
```
### Remote login to a computer using ssh tool

We use the *ssh* command to login to remote computers. The remote
computer must have the *sshd* service running, and should also allow
clients to connect to this service. Let’s try to connect to localhost itself. Remember to start the *sshd* service before this
step.

```
$ ssh kdas@localhost
kdas@localhost's password: 
Last login: Wed Jun 21 08:44:40 2017 from 192.168.1.101
$
```

As you can see, the command syntax is ssh followed by user@hostname. If your remote system's user name is same as your current one, then you can omit the username and just use the hostname(IP address or domain name).

```
$ ssh localhost
kdas@localhost's password: 
$
```

### ssh key generation

ssh keys are used in the daily life of a Linux user or developer. In simple terms, it helps us to securely login to other computers. In the following example, we will create a new key for our user. 

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "kushaldas@gmail.com"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/fedora/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/fedora/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/fedora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:O6Rxir7lpFBQsBnvs+NJRU8Ih01ffVBvLTE8s5TpxLQ kushaldas@gmail.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|  o.o+o   ...*=o |
|   *.o.o .  . @=.|
|  + . o o    =E++|
|   o . o      oo |
|    + o S        |
|   . = * .       |
|  . = = o        |
|   = B   .       |
|    *..          |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

As you can see in the output, the key has been saved in the *~/.ssh* directory. You can also find out that these files are only readable by the owner.

```
$ ls -l .ssh
total 12
-rw-------. 1 fedora fedora 3326 Jun 25 06:25 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--. 1 fedora fedora  745 Jun 25 06:25 id_rsa.pub
```

Each key has two parts. The *id_rsa.pub* is the public key and *id_rsa* is the private part of the key. One can safely upload or use the public key anywhere. But the private key, should be kept in a safe manner, because if people get access to your private key, they can also access all of your information from any system using that key.

In other words, do not give the private key to anyone, or do not randomly copy the *.ssh* directory to a USB drive and then forget about it.

```eval_rst
.. index:: ssh-copy-id
```

### ssh-copy-id 

*ssh-copy-id* command copies the keys to a given remote system. After
this step we can use the ssh key to login to the box directly, instead of the
usual username / password method.

```
$ ssh-copy-id fedora@209.12.123.55
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 2 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys

fedora@209.12.123.55's password:

Number of key(s) added: 2

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'fedora@209.12.123.55'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

### Stop and disable the sshd service

If you don't need ssh access to your computer (say, your laptop), you should always stop and disable the *sshd* service in the computer.

### Disable password based login for ssh

Remember, this step can be **dangerous**.  
Unless you’re really, really sure that you can access a computer by either logging in physically or using your ssh key (and you have a backup of the key somewhere), you should not do this step.

By disabling password based login in the sshd service, you make sure that only people with the right private key can login to the computer. This helps greatly when people try to break into the system by guessing the password. This is also really helpful in case your computer is connected to some network, and you still need to access it over ssh.

We will use vim to open the */etc/ssh/sshd_config* file, which is the configuration file for *sshd* service.

```
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Search for the term *PasswordAuthentication*, and change the value to no. Below I have added a new line to do the same.
You can also understand, that the lines starting with *#* are comments in this configuration file. This configuration will disable password based authentication for the sshd service. You should remember to restart the sshd service after this step for the change to take place.
